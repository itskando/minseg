\f0\fs20 \cf0 connecting to arduino mega 2560: \
\
macos:\
\
\'95\'a0issues:\
\
mac usb: properly connected, power leds are visibly on.\
matlab : hardware support package for arduino: no port available to select\
matlab : command window: [ >> a = arduino() ] --> fails\
macos  : system information: not listed under usb.\
\
\'95\'a0resolution:\
\
download 'arduino IDE' from arduino.cc\
\
arduino ide: \
  tools        --> board    --> arduino mega\
  tools        --> port     --> /dev/cu.usbserial-140\
  file         --> examples --> 01. basics --> blink\
  blink window --> after line: "digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW)" \
                   change the "delay(1000)" to "delay(5000)"\
  sketch       --> upload\
\
actual hardware:\
  board led should be on for 1 second then off for 5\
\
verified: it programs.\
.\
\
download 'CH340 chip driver' (for mac):\
\
source: \
https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/12133/mac-osx-yosemite-no-serial-ports-showing-for-uno-r3\
\
issue is that these boards are chinese knockoffs.\
come with different serial-to-usb IC on hardware.\
installing driver for this IC mostly fixes the issue.\
\
note: install will require restart.\
\
result : port  no appears in macos : system information app: usb. \
result : port     appears in matlab: hardware support package for arduino:\
         >> arduinosetup\
result : port     appears in matlab: arduino() command \'97\
         BUT ONLY for the ch340 driver port which appears in ">> arduinosetup" :\
         >> a = arduino() % <-- run once after startup (:j)\
         >> a = arduino('/dev/cu.wchusbserial1420','mega2560');\
\
         note: if the hardware is not included in the command, it fails.\
