\section{Selection of Control Problem}
\label{SEC:preliminaryDecisions:selectionControlProblem}

The focal control problem was designated to be the \tif{two-wheeled robot}, 
a special case of the \tif{inverted pendulum}.




\subsection{Inverted Pendulum}
\label{SEC:preliminaryDecisions:selectionControlProblem:invertedPendulum}

In control theory, the balancing of an inverted pendulum is a well-established problem~%
\cite{REF:textbook:1995-vaccaro}.

In such a problem, a rigid, column-like mass is used as a pendulum.
One end of the pendulum is mounted to a motoring device.
The mounted end of the pendulum is granted a degree of freedom to rotate.
If the pendulum is inverted {\fns(positioned in a standing position)},
any disturbance will ultimately tip it such that it falls.

One such system is depicted in Figure~%
\ref{FIG:preliminaryDecisions:selectionControlProblem:invertedPendulum}.
In this simple case, the wheels of the cart allow it to move along a one-dimensional plane {\fns(a linear path)}.

The motoring device is used in such a setup to provide counterforces to the mounted end of the pendulum.
These counterforces are intended to ultimately return the top of the pendulum to its inverted {\fns(standing)} position.

For the actuator to successfully perform these actions, a controller {\fns(calculation device)} is required.
The controller, with the assistance of sensory data, is able to dynamically calculate {\fns(in real time)} 
the exact forces needed to reestablish the positioning of the pendulum to a standing equilibrium.
The controller then communicates the magnitude and direction of these forces to the motoring device 
which actuates the forces in the physical space.
This in turn changes the state of the system, 
requiring that the controller continually recalculate the forces needed to return to equilibrium.

This problem may be further complicated by implementing trajectory control,
in which the operator may command the device to move to one or more different locations.
In such a scenario, the device must maintain its control of the balance of the inverted pendulum
during and after moving.




\subsection{Two-Wheeled Robot}
\label{SEC:preliminaryDecisions:selectionControlProblem:twoWheeledRobot}

The two-wheeled robot is a special case of the inverted pendulum model.
In this case, the inverted pendulum model is reduced to only the pendulum and the wheels.
The entirety of the robot hardware forms the pendulum, and
the pendulum is coupled directly to the wheels.

One such device is depicted in Figure~%
\ref{FIG:preliminaryDecisions:selectionControlProblem:twoWheeledRobot}.
In this case, the robot is being used in a medical application.
The significance of the two-wheeled robot is not related to any one application; rather
its ability to balance allows the added inclusion of top-heavy architectures in design options.

The robot has two wheels, 
each of which is coupled to an individual motoring device {\fns(included in the robot hardware)}.
The motoring devices are able to act independently; therefore,
the device is capable of turning and moving across a two-dimensional plane.
This transition from one shaft to two shafts creates additional complexity in the system
which must be considered in the design of the controller.
