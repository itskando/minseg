serial to/from board\\
maximize serial speed\\


Due to the inclusion of a USB port, interfacing with the board is relatively convenient,
whether for programming the board 
or for data transmission during operation.
Additionally, due to the inclusion of multiple UARTs, 
the board can be configured 


-power (see previous section)
-communication: serial (usb or bluetooth)
-wired or wireless



This can be beneficial when the USB connection is already being used to perform communication;
for example, during microcontroller programming 
or during operation for wired data transmission..

During microcontroller programming, this is especially ideal 
since the location and, particularly, the attitude of the robot is not significant.

Contrarily, during operation,
the robot will need to consistently balance at or near an upright position.
While the mass from the cable may be relatively insignificant,
tension in the cable could induce significant disturbance forces on the robot
during trajectory.
These disturbances are beyond the scope of the planned studies,
and therefore will be avoided during testing.
