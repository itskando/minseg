\subsubsection{Power Source}
\label{SEC:preliminaryDecisions:selectionHardwareSoftware:hardware:components:power}

The MinSeg M2V3 offers two independent sources of power:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, itemsep=-1.0em]
\item External power via a USB port
\item Internal power via an embedded battery holster
\end{itemize}

A physical switch exists on the MinSeg device to alternate between the two modes of power sourcing.




\subsubsubsectionA{External-Sourced Power (USB-Cable Connection)}

Externally-sourcing power via the USB port offers a constant 5 [V], per the USB standard;
however, the cable must be consistently connected to the robot body during use.




\subsubsubsectionA{Internal-Sourced Power (Battery Pack)}

As an alternative to externally-sourced power, 
power may be sourced from a battery holster embedded within the MinSeg.
The battery holster permits the installation of 6 AA-sized batteries.

A typical Alkaline AA-sized battery carries 1.5 [V] at maximum charge.
During use, this voltage will rapidly diminish to \raisebox{-0.75ex}{\textasciitilde}1.25 [V],
and more slowly diminish from then on to \raisebox{-0.75ex}{\textasciitilde}1.00 [V]
before rapidly becoming completely discharged, as depicted in Figure~%
\ref{FIG:preliminaryDecisions:selectionHardwareSoftware:hardware:components:power:batteryDrainage}.

\fi%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


To use the battery holster as a power source, all six AA batteries must be installed.
The batteries are connected in series and therefore cumulatively offer up to 9.00 [V] when at full charge.
During typical operation, the batteries will more likely offer a reduced voltage,
\raisebox{-0.75ex}{\textasciitilde}7.50 [V].

Therefore, sourcing power from the battery holster offers consistently greater voltage
than external USB-connected sources,
{\fns(\tif{so long as the batteries are not completely discharged})},
and additionally precludes the use of any wiring which could obstruct testing and operation.
